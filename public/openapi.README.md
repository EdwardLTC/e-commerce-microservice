This OpenAPI JSON was auto-generated by scanning controller files in the `nest-api-gateway-auth` project.

Assumptions and notes:

- Auth endpoints (`/auth/*`) were identified in `src/auth/auth.controller.ts`. DTOs were read from `src/auth/auth.model.ts` and mapped to request schemas.
- Products endpoints were identified in `src/products/products.controller.ts`. DTOs were read from `src/products/products.model.ts` and mapped to request/response schemas.
- Users controller exists (`src/users/users.controller.ts`) but contains no HTTP handlers; it's included as a tag placeholder.
- Security: endpoints guarded by `AuthGuard` (global in `src/main.ts` or controller-level `@ApiBearerAuth`) were annotated with `bearerAuth` security. Public endpoints marked with `@Public()` were left unprotected.
- Response shapes for create/read operations were inferred; services or gRPC responses were not inspected deeply, so the returned `Product`, `OptionType`, `OptionValue`, etc. schemas are conservative and may need exact fields.
- gRPC clients are registered in modules (e.g., `ProductsModule`, `UsersModule`) and reference `.proto` files in the repo; gRPC RPCs are out of scope for OpenAPI and should be documented separately if needed.

Missing/approximate items and next steps:

1. Exact response schemas: The project likely returns richer objects from microservices; if you want exact response schemas, provide the service response DTOs or allow me to inspect service implementation files (e.g., `src/products/products.service.ts`).
2. Add examples: I added some examples where `@ApiProperty` provided them. For others, add example metadata or share sample responses.
3. Validate output: Run `npx swagger-cli validate docs/openapi.json` to validate the file locally. If you want, I can run that command here.

If you'd like, I can:

- Switch the output to YAML.
- Include more precise response schemas by scanning service files and generated code under `src/generated` or the `.proto` folder.
- Add a `docs/openapi.yaml` and wire up a Swagger UI container in `docker-compose.yml`.
